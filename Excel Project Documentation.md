# Road Accident Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze road accident data to identify trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to casualties. By visualizing data through various charts and implementing interactive filters, we aim to provide insights into road safety measures and potential areas for improvement.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes road accident information with the following attributes:
- **Date of accident**
- **Location** (rural/urban)
- **Casualty type** (fatal, slight, serious)
- **Vehicle type**
- **Road type**
- **Road surface condition**
- **Light condition**

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Import the road accident dataset into Excel.
2. Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, and errors.
3. Create calculated fields as required (e.g., year, month).

### Data Analysis and Visualization
1. **Create Pivot Tables:** Summarize data by different dimensions.
2. **Develop Charts to Visualize Data:**
   - **Doughnut Charts:** 
     - Total casualties
     - Fatal casualties
     - Slight casualties
     - Casualties by car
     - Casualties by location
     - Casualties by light condition
   - **Bar Chart:** Casualties by road type
   - **Tree Map:** Casualties by road surface
   - **Line Graph:** Monthly trend of casualties for the current and previous year
3. **Implement Interactive Filters:**
   - Filter by accident date
   - Filter by rural/urban classification

### Insights and Recommendations
1. Analyze the visualized data to identify key trends and patterns.
2. Draw conclusions based on the findings.
3. Provide recommendations for road safety improvements.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of road accident data, offering valuable insights into casualty patterns and contributing factors. The visualizations and interactive filters enable effective exploration and understanding of the data. The findings can be used to inform road safety policies and initiatives to reduce accidents and casualties.
